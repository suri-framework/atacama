# Changes

## 0.0.4

* Introduce Handler Switching – this lets a handler, at any point during the
  lifecycle, switch to a new handler and reinitizialize the connection.

  This is particularly useful for protocol upgrades such as going from HTTP/1.1
  to HTTP/2 or WebSockets.

* Introduce protocol negotiation to support SSL socket pools in Riot 0.0.8

* Expose a direct `Connection.receive` and allow reading an exact number of
  bytes from a connection (useful for sniffing)

* Introduce and update benchmarks in Go, Elixir, Erlang, Eio, and Rust

* Refactor Transport/Socket interfaces to reuse buffers

* Add `echo_test` to verify integrity of data

* Add working TCP echo server example

* Upgrade to Riot 0.0.7

## 0.0.3

* Move example to use Riot Applications
* Started reference projects for benchmarking
* Log socket accept/receive errors
* Always attempt to close a socket

## 0.0.2

* Update to work with Riot 0.0.3

## 0.0.1

First release includes:

* A pluggable architecture, where both Transports and Handlers can be
  configured in an Atacama supervision tree at startup time.

  This makes it easy to swap in the protocol used, which by default will be
  clear TCP sockets.

* Easy-to-define handlers using module includes, so defining a new handler is
  as little as ~5 lines of OCaml.

* A supervision tree for handling connections in an acceptor pool

* Custom state per connection pool

* An echo server example

* Some telemetry events

* Namespaced internal logging
